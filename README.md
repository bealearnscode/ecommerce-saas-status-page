# Magento SaaS

An imaginary SaaS product created by Beatrix.

### Demo: https://bealearnscode.github.io/magento-saas-status-page/


## Getting set up

* You can run this on your local machine by going to localhost:8080 in your browser.

## How to use

* Click on any bar to see availability for a specific day.
* If you do NOT want to see a specific data set in the bar chart, click on its name about the chart.

## What's under the hood

I used vanilla JavaScript and jQuery to render the data from the local JSON file. I did this because I'm not sure how to extract JSON data using React. The data visualization was created with Chart.js. This was my first time doing data visualization, and Chart.js made it so easy! My front end grid and icons were built with the Foundation 6 framework.
